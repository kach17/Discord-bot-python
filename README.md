# Discord bot
## **A simple discord bot made in my free time, feel free to edit the code as you like :)** <br /> <br />This is multi-purpose discord bot made in python with many different cogs such as:

### Admin:
 > For administrating purposes such as muting,unmuting, banning, unbanning etc..

### Anime:
 > For looking for anime and manga details like Ratings, Description, Episodes, Picture, Link to it's MAL Page through jikan API
 
### API:
 > Specifically made cog for miscellaneous APIs including Joke api (which is set to dark by default) and bored API

### Corona:
 > To see corona status of all Indian States and Cities (It is set to my hometown for now you can change the same in 'Corona' cog.)

### Events:
 > Various events for the bot, you can edit these if you want more!
 <br />I'd recommend checking the code out to look for more stuff!
 
###  Fun:

<br />I'd recommend checking the code out to look for more stuff!
